### Hi, I'm Sofia

As of July 2023, I'm working on personal projects and focusing on my Master's studies while also thinking about ambitious ways to improve the world.

I've worked in the game industry and startups since 2017. I taught myself to code as a teenager and hold a Bachelor's in computer science.
