### Hi, I'm Sofi

As of December 2023, I'm working as a freelance software engineer in AI projects focusing on societal issues and individual metacognition, while also pursuing a Master's degree.

I've worked in the game industry and startups since 2017. I taught myself to code as a teenager and hold a Bachelor's in computer science.
