### Hi, I'm Sofia

As of April 2023, I am building something exciting with a very cool team, while also thinking about ambitious ways to improve the world.

I've worked in the game industry and startups since 2017. I taught myself to code as a teenager, hold a Bachelor's in computer science, and have Master's studies on hold.
